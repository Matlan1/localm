"""VRAM-aware model-swap policy for media generation.

Before a media gen (image/music/video via ComfyUI), the chat LLM is unloaded to
hand VRAM to the media model, then reloaded. On a large card both models fit at
once, so the swap is pure latency (and a failed/forgotten reload leaves the card
empty). This module decides whether the swap is actually needed; the unload
endpoint separately verifies VRAM was reclaimed before the media model loads
(the driver-hang guard - see inference/http_server.py).
